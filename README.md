# Workout Buddy Web App

## Introduction

This project is a web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
It was created as a learning exercise for MERN stack development and serves as my first project in this technology stack.

The Workout Buddy Web App allows users to track their workouts by adding, viewing, and deleting workout entries. Each workout entry consists of three pieces of information: Exercise Title, Load (in Kg), and Reps.

## Features

- Add new workouts with title, load, and reps.
- View a list of all workouts added.
- Delete workouts from the list.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: Database for storing workout data.
- Express.js: Backend framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
- React.js: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for running server-side code.
- HTML/CSS: Markup and styling for the web application.
